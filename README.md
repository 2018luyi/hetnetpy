# Heterogeneous Networks in python

Heterogeneous (or multipartite) networks are graphs with multiple node and edge types. They provide a scalable, intuitive, and frictionless structure for data integration. This package provides python data structures for heterogeneous networks as well as algorithms for [edge prediction](http://het.io/hnep/). 

A [study to predict disease-associated genes](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259) formed the impetus for this project. The package is being actively developed for a successive [study to repurpose drugs](https://dx.doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4).

Documentation is currently lacking and the API is unstable. Contributions welcome.

## Classes

A Graph object stores a heterogeneous network and relies on the following classes:

1. Graph
2. MetaGraph
3. Edge
4. MetaEdge
